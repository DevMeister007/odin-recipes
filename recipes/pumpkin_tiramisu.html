            <em>In a large bowl, whisk the pumpkin puree</em> with the brown sugar, 
            ginger, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg and 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar. Add the mascarpone

            <em>In a medium bowl, whisk the brewed coffee</em> with 2 tablespoons of the granulated sugar until itâ€™s dissolved. 
            Dip both sides of 6 ladyfingers in the coffee and arrange them in a single layer in a 4-quart trifle dish. 
            Spread 1 cup of the pumpkin mousse on top. Repeat the layering 5 more times, 
            ending with a layer of the pumpkin mousse. Cover and refrigerate the tiramisu overnight

            <em>In a large bowl, using an electric mixer,</em> beat the remaining 1 cup of cream with the remaining 
            2 tablespoons of granulated sugar until soft peaks form. Dollop the whipped cream over the tiramisu,
