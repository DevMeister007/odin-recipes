        Directions to prepare
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <em>Heat oven to 350Â°F. Line two large cookie sheets with parchment paper a silpat,</em> or lightly spray with nonstick 
            cooking spray. In a large bowl, beat together chocolate cake mix, instant chocolate pudding mix, eggs, 
            water and vegetable oil until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>
            <em>Pour batter into a 1 gallon ziploc bag and seal. </em> Cut a small hole off of one of the bottom corners
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Pipe batter into 36 small circles onto cookie sheets </em> about 1-inch apart (this will allow for spreading).
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>10 to 12 minutes until set. Cool 2 minutes;</em> remove from cookie sheets and place on cooling rack. 
            Cool completely before filling.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>To make the filling:</em> With electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter and sugar together until fluffy, about 2 minutes then beat in vanilla extract. Beat in marshmallow fluff until incorporated. 
            Refrigerate filling until slightly firm, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li><em>Once cookies are cooled,</em> spread filling 
            (about 2 tablespoons - you want a thick filling) on flat side of one cookie.</li>
        <li><em>Top with the second cookie, </em>lat side down to make a sandwich. 
            Whoopie pies can be refrigerated in airtight container for up to 3 days.</li>
    
        <li><b>Cook's Tip:</b>
            Marshmallow fluff can be a bit sticky to work with. 
            Spray your measuring cups with nonstick spray to help it come out easier. Also, 
            when you are spooning the filling onto the cakes, do the same thing. 
            Just spray your spoon with nonstick spray and it will slide right out.</li>
    </ol>
